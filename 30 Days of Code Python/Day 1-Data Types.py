#Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i ,d ,s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

#Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
#Read3  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
#Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
#Print the sum of ilus your int variable on a new line.
#Print the sum of dplus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
#Concatenate swith the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.


i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = 0
b = 0.0
c = " "
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = str(input())
# Print the sum on a new line.
print(i + a)
print(d + b)
print(s + c)
