# Python
Codes are separated into folders based on their difficulty. 

## Way To Execute The Python Codes
* Double click on the files with the extenstion .py as the python files to execute them
* If some files do not open with the command prompt then use the 3rd party applications like Anaconda Spyder to open the codes and execute them.
